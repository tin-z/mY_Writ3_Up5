# TU CTF 2018

TU CTF is an introductory CTF for teams that want to build their experience. We will have the standard categories of Web, Forensics, Crypto, RE, and Exploit, as well as some other categories we don't want to reveal just yet. If you have any questions, our contact is at the bottom of each page, but please read the official rules before sending us any emails.
